# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview

Tom and Seth have a data set holding the result of a vote. We need to analyze the data to find out the election result. To break down, we need total vote cast; vote cast of each county; Candidates' result; who is the winner. 


## Election-Audit Results

Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Which county had the largest number of votes?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
